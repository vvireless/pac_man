# pac cat

Welcome to pac cat! Pac man, but the man has been replaced by a cat. Specifcally speaking, my cat!

Pac cat was inspired by an event that transpired just about a week ago, when my cat knocked over my mom's beloved aloe vera plant. 
After realizing what had happened, my cat sprinted into action while my mom soon followed.

Being given the prompt of pac man, this event was the first thing to pop into my head. What if I turned it into a game? So I turned it into a game.

So once again, welcome to pac cat - where you get to play as my cat Francis.
While my mom was able to catch up and scold Francis in real life...
Can you help him escape this time?
